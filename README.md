Cubesat

Toy program

Working code to be reused.
Testing code thats all :) will probably get updated with mysql ++,
Tcp/ip protocoling using EVPP, and logging using BLACK HOLE. Probably a few others. 
Should eventually place HTML read capabilities in. load a webpage in ImGui window.
That would be useful to retrieve data from external sources. Irc? rss feeds.
Going to look into free hosting solutions.
Basically any idea i want to try out but serves no purpose gets dumped in here.


usage :-

Step #1, Click  'Deploy solar cells' OFF, 
Click 'Dish' ON , Click 'Antenna Transmit' ON

Step #2, Select 'SSD2' from drop down menu, Click 'Download'

Once Download complete.

Step #3, Click 'Antenna Transmit' OFF, Click 'Collect science DATA' ON

Once science data is collected.

Step #4, Turn 'Collect science DATA' OFF, Turn 'Push DATA to PAYLOAD' ON

Once moved goto step #1

- Right click for menu, double right click to remove. 
(WIP Learning buffer copying - Deep copy not shallow)

I always wanted to live in city called Nottingham so i could join nottinghack.
Play with electronics/programming and micro-controller architectures.
Put my engineering skills to use and build/test/launch a cube satellite.
With a camera payloads for color and infra red spectrum.
Take pictures/thermal temperatures ect.


You learn :-

- Micro controllers,
- Storage solutions,
- IC2 networking
- Data Bus,power bus.
- Compressing,transmitting,receiving,
- Require a HAM license.
- Build a OS for the satellite
- Build a application to talk to the cube sat.
- Integrating radio transmitting hardware / code.
- Loads of programming
- Learn SMT soldering skills.
- Loads of maths equations.
- Designing PCBs to be manufactured
- Sensors internal for temperature/opto-electronics. 
- Solar battery charging.

Really fun technically challenging stuff as you have a weight limit. 
And a designated time/day you are allowed to transmit on.
Will have to use fellow HAM enthusiast to help gather your data.
Its a dream :) - Tis why i came up with this =)
